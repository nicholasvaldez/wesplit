# WeSplit

## Overview

WeSplit is a native ios app. When going out to eat at restaurants with a large group, users will sometimes face the problem of splitting the check with tip equally amongst their peers. **WeSplit** solves this problem. All the user needs to do is:

- Input the total check amount
- Select how big their party is
- Choose a tip percentage

and the app will show the total amount each person needs to contribute.
